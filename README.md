# TITLE :

##  Description:
The purpose of my website will be to motivate and inform women on statistics in STEM,
with the main focus being in tech. My goal is to peek women/girls interest as well as encourage them to pursue careers in tech
and other related fields by providing them with information which will begin at the history of tech/programming.

The user will probably already be curious and interested in these fields,
What I will try to convey is a feeling of empowerment and encouragement by also a few optional links to paths for those who are unsure where they can begin.
## API :

the API I will use 
will provide motivational quotes from women all over the world.

## FEATURES:
 I want to incorporate hover features 
 css animations to make the webapp interactive 
 also provide book recommendations as well as links to important historical articles
 related to the overall theme of hte page.


## stretch goals:
a sign up to a daily motivational inspirational quote
an option for sign up where users can create quote snippets they can share on social media platforms.

##Problem-solving approach:
I used good / css tricks for most of the small issues I've had. also reached out to peers and TA for help

##Struggles you encountered and how you solved them:
It took most of the first full day figuring out how to properly display the quotes at random using the button click.

##Problems you werenâ€™t able to solve:
deciding what else to do with the site aesthetically after calling the first API, It turned into a tedious ,boring project/task.

##Code that you are proud of:
I am proud of the Javascript part of my project, as APIs are so tricky and extracting data from them was challenging for me. But I was able to figure something out with the help of peers, and then some on my own.which was awesome.
