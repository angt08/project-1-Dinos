# TITLE :

##  Description:
The purpose of my website will be to motivate and inform women on statistics in STEM,
with the main focus being in tech. My goal is to peek women/girls interest as well as encourage them to pursue careers in tech
and other related fields by providing them with information which will begin at the history of tech/programming.

The user will probably already be curious and interested in these fields,
What I will try to convey is a feeling of empowerment and encouragement by also a few optional links to paths for those who are unsure where they can begin.
## API :

the API I will use 
will provide motivational quotes from women all over the world.

 css animations to make the webapp interactive 
 also provide book recommendations as well as links to important historical articles
 related to the overall theme of hte page.


## stretch goals:
a sign up to a daily motivational inspirational quote
an option for sign up where users can create quote snippets they can share on social media platforms.
